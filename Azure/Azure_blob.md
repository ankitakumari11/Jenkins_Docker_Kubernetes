8. Now u can see, u r not able to access it as public access is prohibited becoz u select access level of container as private.

    <img width="1920" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35a37e30-d1fe-462c-b103-85337c94fcb8" />

9. Now you need to change the access level of container here:

    <img width="1920" height="463" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a634c7fe-dabc-458b-a779-fbd13a50db79" />

10. Here the access should be : blob level but first we need to give access to storage:

    <img width="1914" height="563" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4186804-b728-46bf-8288-e509ab99731d" />

11. Go to storage account and change the access level here first:

     <img width="1920" height="962" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bc4c61d-68f3-48dc-a4d3-91f468835b22" />

     <img width="1919" height="968" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b51150e-8454-4e3f-b21b-bc13ee2974d4" />

12. Now u can change the access level of the container and now try to access the url:

    <img width="1920" height="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4be61c79-a244-4ad8-9a69-ad5b61b23840" />

    <img width="1920" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c84e754-d7fa-447e-92c0-5b969cbbdbfd" />

## üß± What Happened:  
  
- Create Storage Account ‚Üí Your Azure "building" for storing data.
- Create a Container ‚Üí Like a folder inside your storage account.
- Upload a File (Blob) ‚Üí You uploaded a file like cat.jpg.
- Try to Access the File via URL ‚Üí It failed because you had set the container's access level to Private.

**Why Access Failed**

- Private means only authenticated users/services can access the file.
- No public (browser) access allowed.

**üîê Access Levels in Azure Blob Storage (for Containers):**
| **Access Level** | **Who Can Access?**                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Private          | Only authorized users via Azure login/keys               |
| Blob             | Anyone with the blob URL can access the file             |
| Container        | Anyone can list all blobs in the container and access them |

**üõ†Ô∏è What You Did to Fix It:**

- Changed container access level to Blob.
- Allowed public access to the storage account itself.
- After both changes, the blob URL worked in a browser.
